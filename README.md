# simple_sha256
sha256 checksum verifier
This is a simple script to verify the integrity of a file or package.

I have used the base script from https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/python/how-to-calculate-sha256-hash-of-a-file-in-python.html and added my on flavor.

Let me know if you like it or not, or how I can improve.

Thanks
